We attempted to analyse the social network by solving the link
prediction problem for a dataset gathered from Twitch - an online
video streaming platform. We are interested in solving the problem
of personalized recommendations of streamers that a user can follow.
This recommendation problem can be mapped to a binary
classification problem wherein the two classes are - recommend or
do not recommend with features extracted from the dataset
